Eclipse
-------

At time of writing the latest Eclipse release is Juno - 4.2. It can be 
downloaded from `Eclipse Downloads`_. Click the *Latest Release*, and 
download the *Platform Runtime Binary* for your platform.

Extract the package where the user that will install plugins and update 
them has write access. I keep it in my user home.
